	Abstract = {The detection of functional motifs is an important step for the determination of protein functions. We present here a new web server SA-Mot (Structural Alphabet Motif) for the extraction and location of structural motifs of interest from protein loops. Contrary to other methods, SA-Mot does not focus only on functional motifs, but it extracts recurrent and conserved structural motifs involved in structural redundancy of loops. SA-Mot uses the structural word notion to extract all structural motifs from uni-dimensional sequences corresponding to loop structures. Then, SA-Mot provides a description of these structural motifs using statistics computed in the loop data set and in SCOP superfamily, sequence and structural parameters. SA-Mot results correspond to an interactive table listing all structural motifs extracted from a target structure and their associated descriptors. Using this information, the users can easily locate loop regions that are important for the protein folding and function. The SA-Mot web server is available at http://sa-mot.mti.univ-paris-diderot.fr.},

	Abstract = {Understanding and predicting protein structures depend on the complexity and the accuracy of the models used to represent them. A Hidden Markov Model has been set up to optimally compress 3D conformation of proteins into a structural alphabet (SA), corresponding to a library of limited and representative SA-letters. Each SA-letter corresponds to a set of short local fragments of four C[alpha] similar both in terms of geometry and in the way in which these fragments are concatenated in order to make a protein. The discretization of protein backbone local conformation as series of SA-letters results on a simplification of protein 3D coordinates into a unique 1D representation. Some evidence is presented that such approach can constitute a very relevant way to analyze protein architecture in particular for protein structure comparison or prediction.},

It is based on the assembly of fragments taken from a library of reduced size, selected from the encoding of the protein trace in a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet. The assembly of the fragments is achieved by a greedy algorithm, using an energy-based scoring. Alpha-carbon coordinates remain unaffected. SABBAC simply positions the missing backbone atoms, no further refinement is performed. From our tests, SABBAC performs equal or better than other similar on-line approach and is robust to deviations on the alpha-carbon coordinates.

	Abstract = {We have revisited the protein coarse-grained optimized potential for efficient structure prediction (OPEP). The training and validation sets consist of 13 and 16 protein targets. Because optimization depends on details of how the ensemble of decoys is sampled, trial conformations are generated by molecular dynamics, threading, greedy, and Monte Carlo simulations, or taken from publicly available databases. The OPEP parameters are varied by a genetic algorithm using a scoring function which requires that the native structure has the lowest energy, and the native-like structures have energy higher than the native structure but lower than the remote conformations. Overall, we find that OPEP correctly identifies 24 native or native-like states for 29 targets and has very similar capability to the all-atom discrete optimized protein energy model (DOPE), found recently to outperform five currently used energy models.},

	Abstract = {Rational peptide design and large-scale prediction of peptide structure from sequence remain a challenge for chemical biologists. We present PEP-FOLD, an online service, aimed at de novo modelling of 3D conformations for peptides between 9 and 25 amino acids in aqueous solution. Using a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet (SA) of 27 four-residue letters, PEP-FOLD first predicts the SA letter profiles from the amino acid sequence and then assembles the predicted fragments by a greedy procedure driven by a modified version of the OPEP coarse-grained force field. Starting from an amino acid sequence, PEP-FOLD performs series of 50 simulations and returns the most representative conformations identified in terms of energy and population. Using a benchmark of 25 peptides with 9-23 amino acids, and considering the reproducibility of the runs, we find that, on average, PEP-FOLD locates lowest energy conformations differing by 2.6 A Calpha root mean square deviation from the full NMR structures. PEP-FOLD can be accessed at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/PEP-FOLD.},

	Abstract = {Although peptides have many biological and biomedical implications, an accurate method predicting their equilibrium structural ensembles from amino acid sequences and suitable for large-scale experiments is still missing. We introduce a new approach-PEP-FOLD-to the de novo prediction of peptides and miniproteins. It first predicts, in the terms of a Hidden Markov Model-derived structural alphabet, a limited number of local conformations at each position of the structure. It then performs their assembly using a greedy procedure driven by a coarse-grained energy score. On a benchmark of 52 peptides with 9-23 amino acids, PEP-FOLD generates lowest-energy conformations within 2.8 and 2.3 A Calpha root-mean-square deviation from the full nuclear magnetic resonance structures (NMR) and the NMR rigid cores, respectively, outperforming previous approaches. For 13 miniproteins with 27-49 amino acids, PEP-FOLD reaches an accuracy of 3.6 and 4.6 A Calpha root-mean-square deviation for the most-native and lowest-energy conformations, using the nonflexible regions identified by NMR. PEP-FOLD simulations are fast-a few minutes only-opening therefore, the door to in silico large-scale rational design of new bioactive peptides and miniproteins.},

@article{Neron:2009uq,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: For the biologist, running bioinformatics analyses involves a time-consuming management of data and tools. Users need support to organize their work, retrieve parameters and reproduce their analyses. They also need to be able to combine their analytic tools using a safe data flow software mechanism. Finally, given that scientific tools can be difficult to install, it is particularly helpful for biologists to be able to use these tools through a web user interface. However, providing a web interface for a set of tools raises the problem that a single web portal cannot offer all the existing and possible services: it is the user, again, who has to cope with data copy among a number of different services. A framework enabling portal administrators to build a network of cooperating services would therefore clearly be beneficial. RESULTS: We have designed a system, Mobyle, to provide a flexible and usable Web environment for defining and running bioinformatics analyses. It embeds simple yet powerful data management features that allow the user to reproduce analyses and to combine tools using a hierarchical typing system. Mobyle offers invocation of services distributed over remote Mobyle servers, thus enabling a federated network of curated bioinformatics portals without the user having to learn complex concepts or to install sophisticated software. While being focused on the end user, the Mobyle system also addresses the need, for the bioinfomatician, to automate remote services execution: PlayMOBY is a companion tool that automates the publication of BioMOBY web services, using Mobyle program definitions. AVAILABILITY: The Mobyle system is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2 on the project web site (http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/projects/mobyle/). It is already deployed on three servers: http://mobyle.pasteur.fr, http://mobyle.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr and http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/Mobyle.

We are mostly specialized in molecular model printing, so the service is fully open to the chemo/bioinformatics community, but also to other domains. Can we print anything else than molecules? Yes! We are able to print any CAO object, the only constrain is to send us a supported file format (e.g. ZBD, STL, BLD, PLY, ZCP, SFX, 3DS, ZEC, ZPR and VRML). I know a bit of molecular viewing, can I submit my model via a PyMol session file? Sure, we support the three main viewers, e.g. PyMol, VMD and Chimera. Your session file can be uploaded as a CAO object in the submission form (pricing section). I don't have any structure for my protein, can you help? Yes! The RPBS platform can provide its strong experiment in protein structure prediction to provide a printable model of your favorite polypeptide.

	Abstract = {A new 3D printing service is now open @ University Paris Diderot - located at the MTi laboratory (INSERM U973) - RPBS Platform. We are mostly specialized in molecular model printing, so the service is fully open to the chemo/bioinformatics community, but also to other domains. Can we print anything else than molecules? Yes! We are able to print any CAO object, the only constrain is to send us a supported file format (e.g. ZBD, STL, BLD, PLY, ZCP, SFX, 3DS, ZEC, ZPR and VRML). I know a bit of molecular viewing, can I submit my model via a PyMol session file? Sure, we support the three main viewers, e.g. PyMol, VMD and Chimera. Your session file can be uploaded as a CAO object in the submission form (pricing section). I don't have any structure for my protein, can you help? Yes! The RPBS platform can provide its strong experiment in protein structure prediction to provide a printable model of your favorite polypeptide. In this case, please contact us via our contact form to describe your system. To see more examples of printed models, take a look at our gallery: http://3dprinter.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/models/gallery/},
